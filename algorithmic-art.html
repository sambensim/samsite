            <h2>Algorithmic Art</h2>
            <p>
                There's been a recent push to find an alternate name for "generative art" in light of the growing popularity of generative AI. "Algorithmic art" is the best suggestion I've seen so far.
            </p>
            <p>
                I really enjoy learning new programs and have previously created pieces using Pico8, Godot, GLSL, Java, Scratch, and TouchDesigner, but my general favorite is p5js. My sketches are generally founded on some mathematical concept and grow from there, often heavily inspired by the algorithmic art community on social media.

                    p5js static image generator. Points are colored based on both distance from the nearest circle (discounting circles they are inside of) and distance from the innermost concentric circle. The star of the show, however, is the texture created by multiple layers of noise functions adjusting both brightness and saturation.

                    p5js web visualization. Inspired by flow fields and MoMA's "ClockClock 24". The clock's hands have a gravitational pull, both drawing in the dots and mixing them with a primary color.

                    p5js web visualization. What started as an implementation of the Boids algorithm to simulate flocking became something all together different when I changed the order of the rules so that avoidance came first. Here, each boid is invisible except for when it's close enough to another boid to be able to "see" it.
