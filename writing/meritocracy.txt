## The Myth of Meritocracy

Proponents of capitalism cite two primary attributes as it's boons:
1. Competition balances the market: where something can be made more efficiently, it will be economically beneficial to do so and will therefore be done. Where onerous prices take advantage of the people, competitors may introduce themselves to bring down the prices. In this way, creativity and the efficient use of resources are (supposedly) the traits of the individual that capitalism rewards and drives to the top. Those who find themselves at the top of the economic power pyramid, capitalism claims, find themselves there only because they have earned it.
2. As opposed to Marx's "\[f\]rom each according to his ability, to each according to his needs," which is often hard to enforce and some claim unrealistic, capitalism provides a sort of 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution.' Here, capitalism attempts to tie the good of the society to the good of the individual, that is to say, since a functioning society relies on the sum contributions of individuals, why not reward the individuals in proportion to their usefulness?

In combination these attributes form the myth of the meritocracy. This myth is doubly deceitful – not only does capitalism claim that it is a meritocracy, but it subtly (and firmly) claims that meritocracies are good. This second claim is what makes the idea of capitalism so dangerous – while one may or may not believe that capitalism is a 'good' economic system, if they believe that the goal of any economic system is or should be to facilitate a meritocracy, it's hard to come up with alternatives to capitalism that aren't just variants on it governed by slightly different rules.

The fundamental sin of modern capitalism is that an individual’s money does not, in practice, represent one-to-one the contribution of that individual to society. The fundamental sin of capitalism as a whole is its advocacy for meritocracy as the ultimate among just systems. In other words, not only is capitalism not the meritocracy it claims to be, but even if it were, meritocracies are not the perfect system they're advertised to be.

Michael Young writes in *The Rise of the Meritocracy* (the text often cited as responsible for the popularization of the word "Meritocracy") that within political systems "intelligence and effort together make up merit" ("The Rise..." 94). Just a few months ago, the president of the US said "[w]e believe that if you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer, or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence... you should be hired based on merit" ("Remarks..."). Most damning, though, is Jonathan Mijs' essay in the _Socio-Economic Review_: "citizens in unequal societies are less concerned than those in more egalitarian societies... the more unequal a society, the more likely its citizens are to explain success in meritocratic terms, and the less important they deem nonmeritocratic [sic] factors such as a person’s family wealth and connections" ("The Paradox..." Abstract).

The first problem is that modern capitalism isn't the meritocracy it claims to be.

Pope Francis's 2021 Address ("...Holy Father to the Popular Movements") is critical of "the technocratic paradigm" - a governmental system where those with the requisite technical expertise find themselves with the most power. The difference between a technocracy and a meritocracy may not immediately be clear: those at the top of a technocracy are those who are more skilled than those below them while those at the top of a meritocracy are those who have worked the hardest.
 
 Setting aside the fact of how difficult it would be to quantify the effort people put into their work, technocracies explicitly filter out those with unequal access to education. In a meritocracy, anyone willing to put in the work to learn a skill would be put at the top of that skill's field while a technocracy only considers those who already hold a skill. In either case,  all that needs to be done to show whether or not we live in such a system is to examine the skill levels of those at the extremes of the power structure (where we might find those who put in the most effort nearer the bottom or those at the top not necessarily being the most skilled).

Why though, is meritocracy such a blight among ideals?

Meritocracy implies mobility – if merit = intelligence + effort, anyone with proper work ethic and intellectual ability should be able to find their place among the most powerful of the society. The issue is that intelligence is more often a result of education which in turn is a result of more arbitrary factors such as parental wealth and school location. Furthermore – and as previously described – modern capitalism doesn't even reward Young's definition of merit, rather, it defines merit as some function of opportunity and wealth. The seminal 2014 report "Restoring Opportunity: The Crisis of Inequality and the Challenge for American Education" from the Harvard Education Press illustrates the near complete irrelevance of effort or genetics to actual academic success: "Children from families in the top 20 percent of the income distribution already outscore children from the bottom 20 percent by 106 points [where 100 points represents one standard deviation] in early literacy... the reading gap was even larger when the same children were tested in fifth grade" (pg. 22).

The twist is thus: when Young wrote *The Rise of the Meritocracy*, it was meant as a warning of the dangers of meritocracy, not as the introduction of the meritocratic ideal to popular society. His argument against what he saw as the dangers of 2034 became the realities of the present. Not only that, but they became the realities that we – as a society – seem to strive for.

Pope Francis, in discussion of his 2015 *Laudato Si*, claims "\[t]he so called 'progress' we're following now, the supremacy of the economy, turns us more and more into slaves" ("The Letter" 26:45). This idea of the "supremacy of the economy" is used often as justification for immoral acts. Capitalism's single-minded focus on the health of itself is what allows the justification of the dehumanization and exploitation of the worker (see arguments against minimum wage increases, safer working conditions, shorter work weeks, and the arguments for decreasing the minimum work age and general deregulation).

The Forest Jar's animated short "A Game of Michaels" describes a game wherein anyone named Michael scores points and no one else can. In this game, the winner, Michael, claims that his victory was earned, and rightly so – he took advantage of the system better than anyone else. This system, in an abstract sense, *is* a meritocracy – Michael was the best at being named Michael, the skill this meritocracy happens to value above all others.

Any meritocracy must take a position on what merits should be valued and what shouldn't. The modern system claims to value economic creativity and efficient use of resources but really values understanding and manipulation of its own inner workings (see how many people specialize in specific aspects of the economy – accountants, financial lawyers, traders, analysts). If capitalism really rewards contributions to society, what contributions do those who exploit capitalism (e.g. stock traders) provide that necessitates they be rewarded the most?

Back to the Pope's critique of technocracies – the issue is that "technocracy" becomes a twisted deterioration of a "meritocracy" wherein the skilled *are* rewarded the most but the ability for any individual to become skilled is obscured, so power is concentrated among those that have the means to learn (similar to the criticism of "capitalist globalization" where a rigid power structure is disguised as one with individual mobility).

Did you spot the issue there? Yes, technocracy is a downgrade of meritocracy, but if meritocracy is the goal, capitalism is at the forefront. Meritocracy, however, is only the goal because capitalism makes it so! This circular logic sprouts "all roads lead to Rome" in favor of capitalism simply because capitalism is the one defining the goal; capitalism defines where the roads end.
