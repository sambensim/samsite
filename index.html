            <h2>Hi Mozilla & TIAT!</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a computer science student soon to graduate from the University of San Francisco. I love tech and coding, but feel its uses as a practical tool often overshadows its potential as an artistic medium. The ability to be creative in how I solve problems and what problems I solve was what drew me into computer science, and though I've enjoyed school, I haven't had many opportunities to express myself here as I would have liked.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't really know what I want to do after graduation, but I know I don't want to work without the ability to use technology in some sort of creative way. Other than this residency, I'm applying to a couple Creative Coding masters programs, a scifi writing workshop, and panicking about what to do. This opportunity to craft with guidance and without it being just a "side-project" will be a first for me, and I'm so hopeful for what that may bring.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here you will find some of my various experiments. Few were made with the intention of being "art," rather they were most often challenges I set myself and completed in just a few hours. I hope to use this residency to create more intentional pieces and to explore technology as a creative medium.

                    p5js web visualization with JavaScript and HTML. What started as an implementation of the Boids algorithm to simulate flocking became something all together different when I changed the order of the rules so that avoidance came first. Here, each boid is invisible except for when it's close enough to another boid to be able to "see" it.
