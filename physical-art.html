            <h2>Physical Art</h2>
            <p>
                Long before it was an academic subject or a personal passion, programming, for me, was simply a means by which I could express myself along the ever-expanding digital frontier. I've always jumped around from one medium to another, but invariably I come back to technology as the root. When I carve, I carve in pixels, when I write, I write about machines, when I crochet, I crochet computers, when I draw, I draw with algorithms, and when I code, I code for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I may be really pushing the definition of "physical" here as I'm including digital art. I really just mean "not algorithmic," but that doesn't have the same ring.

                    A crochet replica of the original Mac 128k including a plug-in keyboard and 0.5 kilo-bit SSD (Super Soft Drive; binary embroidered into a crochet rectangle). Screen projection mapping with touchdesigner.

                    A digital, detailed sketch of a fly with the text "Decomposition - in and of itself" below it. Printed on semi-gloss photo paper as part of a digital printing course. (I lost the original image, I plan to photograph the print after the holidays)

                    A stylized transcription of one of my favorite poems and its title. The image is digitally textured with the lines and fiber-marks of canvas along with the appearance of damage and wear over time. Printed on heavy-weight matte paper as part of a digital printing course. (I lost the original image, I plan to photograph the print after the holidays)

                <h3>Pixel Proof of Concept</h3>
                <img src="images/IMG_6460.png" alt="Lorem, ipsum">
                <p>
                    A pixelated eye drawn in pen and ink on graph paper. This proof of concept asks how well digital imagery techniques translate to physical mediums and what the new medium adds. The full piece is planned to explore the techniques used in RGB color displays.
