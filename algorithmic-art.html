                    p5js web visualization with JavaScript and HTML. Inspired by flow fields and MoMA's "ClockClock 24". The clock's hands have a gravitational pull, both drawing in the dots and mixing them with a primary color.

                    p5js web visualization with JavaScript and HTML. What started as an implementation of the Boids algorithm to simulate flocking became something all together different when I changed the order of the rules so that avoidance came first. Here, each boid is invisible except for when it's close enough to another boid to be able to "see" it.
