                    A digital, detailed sketch of a fly with the text "Decomposition - in and of itself" below it. Printed on semi-gloss photo paper as part of a digital printing course. (I lost the original image, I plan to photograph the print soon)

                    A stylized transcription of one of my favorite poems and its title. The image is digitally textured with the lines and fiber-marks of canvas along with the appearance of damage and wear over time. Printed on heavy-weight matte paper as part of a digital printing course. (I lost the original image, I plan to photograph the print soon)

                    A pixelated eye drawn in pen and ink on graph paper. This proof of concept asks how well digital imagery techniques translate to physical mediums and what the new medium adds. The full piece is planned to explore the techniques used in RGB color displays.
