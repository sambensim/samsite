            <h2>Hi!</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a computer science student soon to graduate from the University of San Francisco. I love tech and coding, but feel its uses as a practical tool often overshadows its potential as an artistic medium. The ability to be creative in how I solve problems and what problems I solve was what drew me into computer science, and though I've enjoyed school, I haven't had many opportunities to express myself here as I would have liked.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't really know what I want to do after graduation, but I know I don't want to work without the ability to use technology in some sort of creative way. Other than this residency, I'm applying to a couple Creative Coding masters programs, a scifi writing workshop, and panicking about what to do. This opportunity to craft with guidance and without it being just a "side-project" will be a first for me, and I'm so hopeful for what that may bring.
